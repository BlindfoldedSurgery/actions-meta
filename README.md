# actions-meta

This repository contains a set of reusable workflows geared that apply to generic GitHub 
repositories.

The project follows semantic versioning. You can depend on tags for specific versions of use a
major version tag (e.g. `v1`).

Every commit on the main branch leads to a new release. Releases are managed by
[commitizen][commitizen], which relies on [conventional commits][ccommit]. To make sure you don't
accidentally create commits with an unconventional message, install a pre-commit hook using
`make pre-commit`.

## Example
